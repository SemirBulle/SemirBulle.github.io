<h2> Secondary </h2>
															<h4>Prerequisite courses</h4>
															<ul>
																<li>Secondary 5 or 068-536 SN or TS Mathematics or equivalent</li>
																<li>Secondary 5 physics or 054-534 or 584 or equivalent</li>
																<li>Secondary 5 chemistry or 051-534 or 584 or equivalent </li>
															</ul>

<h4> Advice</h4>
															<ul>
																<li>It is important to choose the mathematics and advanced science courses in secondary 4, which allows access to the secondary 5 courses. </li>
																<li> The results of secondary 4 and secondary 5 (semesters one and two) will be considered by the CEGEPs. Thus, the averages you obtain are essential in gaining admission into the CEGEP program that interests you. Indeed, the natural sciences and Sciences, Letters and Arts programs often fill up during the first round of requests to the CEGEP. </li>

<h2> CEGEP </h2>

<h4> <I> Introduction </I> </h4> 
									<p>The first selection step for medicine, as well as for all limited university programs, is the college performance rating (R-score). Thus, throughout CEGEP, the first thing to do in order to offer yourself the best chance of getting into medicine is to study and successfully complete the courses to the best of your ability. Medical admissions committees will take into account not only academic performance, but also the candidates' non-academic qualities such as compassion, empathy, integrity, stress management, etc. The CanMEDS guide is a valuable tool for understanding what skills and qualities the programs are looking for in their candidates. These skills will be assessed through multiple mini-interview form (MEM) interviews, the online CASPER test and, sometimes, the curriculum vitae.

</p>

<h4>Programs leading to eligibility for a doctorate of medicine </h4>
<ul>

		<li> A DEC in sciences, letters and arts </li>
<li>A DEC in natural sciences and having achieved objectives 00XU (biology) and 00XV (chemistry)</li>
<li>Another college diploma (DEC) awarded by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, and having successfully completed the following prerequisite courses before entering the program: </b> </li> </ul>
<ol>
	<li> Biology 301 and 401 or two courses in human biology </li>
	<li> Chemistry 101, 201 and 202 </li>
	<li> Math 103 and 203 </li>
	<li> Physics 101, 201 and 301</li> </ol>
<ul>
	<li> A post-secondary diploma recognized by the University as equivalent to a DEC, or a university bachelor's degree obtained in Quebec and having successfully completed the prerequisite courses mentioned above or courses deemed equivalent in each of the four subjects. </li>
	<li> A recognized undergraduate degree equivalent to a bachelor's degree and having successfully completed the above prerequisite courses or equivalent courses in each of the four disciplines. </li>
	<li> A medical doctorate degree awarded by a medical school recognized by the Medical Council of Canada and having successfully passed the Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE). </li> 
									
</ul>

<h4> R-score </h4>

<p> The college performance rating (R rating) is a common measure of college student performance. All courses are included in the calculation of the R-score except the refresher courses. Weighting is based on the number of units specific to each course.  </p>

<li>There is no pre-med and the program runs over 4 years. </li>

<li>Teaching is face-to-face and includes self-studying at home. It focuses on problem-based learning and clinical learning. There are almost no lectures. </li>

<li> The learning method is symptom based, which is a particularity at Sherbrooke. </li>

<li>The program focuses on self-learning </li>

<li>	The teaching methods are diverse and interactive, in particular the APP method, which is Problem-based Learning. </li>

<li>	The teaching material is fully digitized. You won't have any books to buy.</li>

<li>Clinical immersion begins in the third month of the first year of medicine.</li> 

<li>The educational activities allow you to expose yourself very early in the clinic. Thus, there are several opportunities to do emergency consultations or volunteer in the community.</li>

<li>Students have access to a mentor doctor who will accompany them throughout their journey
 </li>
</ul>

<h4><U> 
McGill University </u> </h4>

<ul> 

<li> Two campuses starting in fall 2020: Montreal and Gatineau.</li>

<li>	A “Med-P” preparatory year for students admitted after CEGEP. About 40% of the cohort comes directly from CEGEP.</li>

<li>During the first 1.5 years of medicine, lectures are offered every morning and problem-based learning sessions are offered in the afternoons to consolidate information.</li>

<li>It is the school with the most clinical exposure, as students spend 2.5 years in a clinical setting.</li> 

<li> The curriculum is separated into three parts (after the preparatory year):
<ol> <li> 	Basic training in medicine and dentistry during the 1st year and the first six months of the 2nd year</li>
<li> 	The transition to clinical practice in the last six months of the 2nd year</li>
<li> Clerkship in 3rd and 4th year </li> </ol>

<li>Students have access to the medical simulation center where the sessions are simulated by professional actors. The center contains a surgical simulation area, clinical meeting rooms, ultrasound equipment, and others.</li>

<li>The courses are taught in English, but there are several opportunities to practice medicine in French. Several interactions with patients in clinical settings are done in French, sessions at simulation centers can also be done in French. The French clinical club offers monthly workshops so that students can practice their mastery of clinical French. The faculty also offers weekly French lessons to English speakers.</li>


</ul>

<h4><U> And if you don't get into medicine ... </u> </h4>

<p> <i> <b> Reminder: </b> </i> Volunteering, whether in a hospital or not, allows you to gain experience and life skills that will be useful in future medical interviews. The more experience you have, the better! For example, take advantage of this time to shadow a doctor. How to? Search online or contact close friends/family members to find a doctor working in a discipline that interests you. You can even ask your family doctors! </p>

<p> <b> Here are some options available to you</p> </b>

<ol> <li> <u>  Sabbatical year </u>
Opportunity to travel, work, start a project ... </li>

<ul> <li> 	Great opportunity to improve your work experience, such as getting involved in research projects or working in a medical center. You could also work as a research assistant. One tip is to start by looking for jobs through the job banks in your schools. </li>

<li>This option only applies to people with a high academic standing who will remain competitive the following year. </li> </ul>

<li> <u> Go to the University</u>
Choose a related program that you like. You have to be prepared to possibly stay in this program. Here are some examples. </li>

<ul> <li> Anatomy and cell biology at McGill </li> 

<li> Physiotherapy / Ergotherapy </li> 

<li> Pharmacy at (UdeM and ULaval) </li> 

<li> Psychology </li> </ol> </ul>


<p> <b> 
Frequently Asked Questions About University Programs  </p> </b>

<p> <i> <b> Can my choice of university program influence my chances of admission to medicine? </b> </i> <hr class="major" />

<ul> <li> First of all, it should be understood that each university program follows a literal grading scale (D to A +) which will then be converted to 4.33, for example 4.33 = A + = 90% and up. But how do you compare 2 people from 2 different programs with a general average of 4.33 (A +)?</li> 
 

<li> To be able to compare programs against each other, schools use a university performance rating as a comparison tool. The University Achievement Rating (CRU) is a conversion of the GPA to an R rating that takes into account the "program strength index". For example, a 4.0 GPA in physiotherapy would not give the same R rating as a 4.0 in psychology (fictitious ex: 37 versus 33 with an R rating).</li> 
 
<li> Thus, some programs have good indicators of program strength, and therefore allow more people to reach the performance level necessary to be able to receive medical interviews! </li> </ul>

<p> <i> <b> How to know the strength index of a program in order to make an informed choice? </b> </i> <hr class="major" />

<p> <I> Laval University </I>

<ul> <li>The university offers a standard that groups the performance ratings for each of their programs according to the scores obtained. This standard applies only to Laval University. For example, if you finish with a 4.0 in biomedical sciences, this would be equivalent to 32,872 versus 4.0 in psychology = 30,383 for admission in fall 2020. 

<li>If you are in a bachelor’s in biomedical sciences at UdeM and you apply with a GPA of 4.0 in medicine at Laval, your assigned R-score will be as mentioned above. Usually, the ratings given by the University of Montreal tend to be higher than Ulaval for the same program. For example, 2 years of kinesiology with a GPA of 4.26 is equivalent to ~ 35.77, while the University of Montreal rated the score at 36.387. Here is the standard of R-score according to the program offered by Laval (for the fall 2020 admissions): <a href="https://www.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/admission/table-des-etalons.pdf">Click here</a>  </p> </ul> </li> </li>   
 
<p> <I>UdeM </i>

<ul> <li>There is no way to know the strength index at the outset. However, the UdeM site (link below) provides students with the opportunity to request their performance rating following a refusal of admission only. If your CEGEP R-score is/was really low, it is relevant, in our opinion, to apply into a program like medicine after one year of university, knowing that the refusal is inevitable. Thus, it will allow you to see the evolution of your CEGEP R-Score after the first university session and possibly for the rest of your university career if necessary.

<ol> <li>  Select in Nature of request: Questions relating to admission</li>
<li> Select in subject: Request your performance rating </ol> </p> </ul> </li> 

<p> <i> <b> After I start college, will my R score from CEGEP still count? </b> </i> <hr class="major" />

<ul> <li> On the other hand, it is important to know that the university works with the GPA rating system, a rating that goes up to 4.33 for all universities except McGill (4.0). Each GPA is converted into a university performance rating (CRU), a university version of the R-Score of the CEGEP. This calculation takes into account "the strength index of a program" and makes it possible to compare the programs with each other. For example, a 4.0 in biochemistry could give a university rating of 33 and a 4.0 in physiotherapy a university rating of 36. Hence, choosing a good program is helpful in attaining a good university performance rating. </li> 
 
<li> At the university, the proportion granted to the CEGEP R-Score of each university credit decreases by 2%. If we take the example of a typical session of 15 credits at the university in physiotherapy with an average of 4.0., 15 credits x 2% = 30% will be awarded to your university rating and 70% for your CEGEP rating. Fictitious example: you had a 31 at CEGEP, and now a 4.0 in physio would give you a 36 according to the university's calculation. Your final rating (CEGEP + university) for admission will be 32.5 after one university session. </li> </p> </ul>

<p> <i> <b> Can I delete my r rating?</b> </i> <hr class="major" />
<ul> <li> After 50 university credits, university marks count for 100% (50 x 2% = 100%) of your rating. In general, 50 credits are achievable with a minimum of 3 university sessions, i.e. one year and a half. So, if you have a fairly low college R-score, it would take you at least 2 years to completely erase your CEGEP if it doesn’t match your desired score. It is possible to increase your R-score for those who are already close enough to the medicine admissions R-score (for example, 32.5 - 34 of R-Score during CEGEP).  </ul> </li> </p>


<h4><U>Particularities of admission to the University of Sherbrooke
</u> </h4>

<ul> <li> Sherbrooke considers candidates with less than 45 credits (44 and less) to be in the college and non-university category.</li> 

<li> As we have seen above, the R-scores in the university category tend to be higher than the college quota and places are more limited to academics.</li> 

<li> Considering what was mentioned said above, after 3 university sessions, we strongly suggest that you finish with less than 45 credits in order to increase your chances of admission to UdeS.</li> </ul>
