If you are reading this, it means you’re contemplating pursuing a career in medicine. We want to first congratulate you on making that decision for yourself! Thinking about your future can always lead to some feelings of stress and anxiety. Accessing this guide is an amazing first step towards actualizing your goal of becoming a future physician.</p>

<p>If you have not heard this yet, just know that there are already a group of students rooting for you! A large group of medical students from across Canada have contributed to the creation of this guide, with the hopes of providing you with ample support on your own path to medicine. The advice provided within the guide is aimed to raise awareness of the components that we believe are important to consider when applying to medicine. Having said that, the advice we are giving is <strong>NOT</strong> set in stone. At the end of the day, we encourage you to pursue experiences that are enjoyable for YOU, even if they are not listed in the guide.</p>

<p>Before diving deeper, it is also very important to note that each individual admitted into medicine had their own unique journey. That will become apparent to you as you explore the different pathways to medicine laid out in this chapter. In fact, a large proportion of medical students follow unconventional routes and may not even have intensive human biology backgrounds. So while reading through, please remember that there is not one path that is greater than another.
